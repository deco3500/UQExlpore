<b>1.0 Introduction</b>

News and information broadcasted around the University of Queensland has two major flaws. There is a lot of it, and only a small percentage of that information actually reaches its intended marketed audience. There is not enough awareness of UQ social events and many things on offer that may be of interest to students get overlooked. With 50 000 potential individuals to connect and inform, broad UQ Union emails send out at the end of each week simply isn’t enough. 
To solve this issue, we have proposed a mobile application that aims to advertise local news and social events to the students of UQ in a fun and engaging way. We will introduce features such as food discounts on the campus via interactive games through the app, a notification system that notifies you of social events in your surrounding areas and maps on market day that outline locations of stalls and attractions. All of these aspects will be found under UQ Explore, where students will be able to broadcasts every side of the university from the palm of their hands. We will create a social network that caters primarily to a university body.  




2.0 Concept


2.1 Outline

The use of mobile phones is one of the most popular forms of electronic communication. The majority of young individuals use their cellphones to organise and maintain their social networks. This is the perfect means to be tapped into as a platform to broadcast events to a person, in this case, the  students. (Campbell,2005 )
By using this kind of app, the student will enhance their navigation experience around uni by using interactive campus maps. It will facilitate a connection with classmates and faculty, not only by helping make new friends through social media integration but by having more access to social events around campus. (TapWalk,2010).


2.2 Project Aims and Audience 

For this project, the intended audience is students and possibly staff of UQ, across all campuses. Students will be able to sign into the app with their student ID, and staff with their staff ID. Presidents of clubs and faculty will be granted access to post about upcoming events. Otherwise, there will be a forum where students can place a request to post, which will be decided upon via an admin group. 
The application aims to raise awareness about UQ based events making them more discoverable by students, as well as providing more information about these events which include Market Day, Election Day, Come-and-try events, and Sausage Sizzles. UQ Explore will also allow students to participate in limited time offers provided by participating food outlets across campus. These offers will require the students to participate in a game that will see them shaking their devices to receive discounts on food items.  Students will have only a certain amount of time to retrieve their discount. The application will also notify the users about events that are taking place near them according to the interests that they selected upon signing up. This helps create an environment where students receive news and information they enjoy, so that more continual use can be reached. 
UQ Explore will aim to establish partnerships with businesses and the UQ Union to fully deliver on its intended functionality, with such partnerships allowing revenue to be generated through the integration of vouchers for businesses within UQ. Election day vouchers received from voting can be received through the app, cutting down on paper cost and waste. 
While current aims are targeted to social events, future implementations could aim to include facility updates  and information nights more specific to degrees. UQ has a lot of information on offer and there are many different facilities and boards that could use this app to really broadcast their institutions. To begin with however, we are primarily focusing on the social and networking aspect and only after we have this foundation can we expand the functionality of the application.  


2.3 Comparing to Existing Systems

UQ Explore works on ideas closely related to both the Hungry Jacks and Meetup applications, but it differs in how these features will be implemented. In this application, users will login using their UQ student or staff details and select their interests from a variety of options. The application will then search for events, discounts, or news near the user that relates to his/her interests and will notify the user about such events through push notifications or in app alerts. This will work similarly to how the Meetup app presents information and events that cater to the user’s interests. The user will also be able to play a mini-game where they can shake their phone to receive a limited-time discount on food items a la the Hungry Jacks application.
An example of a social networking app that has been successfully implemented, is the one developed by the University of South Wales (2015). The students can chat with surrounding individuals, meet people with mutual interests, find students or tutors to help them with assignments and projects and all round keep connected.

3.2 How will we work together 

We will model our work ethic after the Scrum Methodology. We will have sprints every two weeks and ‘daily’ scrums twice a week.  In this time will delegate new roles and revise current work being done, as well as discuss improvements, resolve any difficulties within the scope and work to resolve concerns outside our control. We will utilize the scrum values of Focus, Courage, Openness, Commitment and Respect.  We will base the sprint workload on the outlined discussed in section 5 below. 

3.3 How decisions will be made 

Major decisions will be decided upon with a vote from the team. If there is a hung vote, we will openly discuss and include additional tutor input. Once a tutor has given feedback, based on that feedback we will reevaluate and continue from there.

3.4 How will the team handle poor performance and resolve conflicts address?

Firstly, we will discuss with that particular team member if they are capable of doing and/or happy with the work they are assigned and possibly change that role to benefit the team. If further poor performance or conflict occurs, we will seek out tutor help and input.





4.0 Communication  


4.1 Meet 

Friday during practical. Additionally, once a week on Tuesday at 5pm in GP South room 221

4.2 Communication 

We will communicate through our slack channel: https://deco3500.slack.com/messages/uqexplore/   as well as our facebook group page and email. 
A Google Drive folder will be used to store and share files. Folder’s will be named after each piece of assessment, and any contents will be named according to what it is.

4.2 Social Platforms 

Facebook has been chosen as our platform of choice because of its accessibility and it is easy to be notified, as well as allows all team members to message each other and upload files. We will also use slack as it is a tool recommended by the course and allows for communication between group members. Google drive allows for multiple edits on the one file at the same time, so is useful for collaborative reports and documents. 




5.0 Plan


5.1 

The “UQ Explore” project worksheet has been divided into seven phases, with tasks, deliverables and milestones outlined for each phase. These tasks will be monitored and measured based on the five parameters.
1. Plan Start – Start week for the project e.g. “1” denotes the beginning of the week for that semester.
2. Plan Duration – It denotes how many weeks required to complete the task.
3. Actual Start – It denotes when the assigned task started.
4. Actual Duration – It denotes total time taken to the particular task to get completed.
5. Percent Complete – It denotes that how much work completed during that assigned week. 
The worksheet has five labels which help to indicate and measure the actual status of the project. These labels are “Plan”, “Actual”, “% Complete”, “Actual (beyond plan)” and “%Complete Beyond Plan”.

The following task have been identified as crucial milestones for the brief and mentioned in the Gantt Chart bellow.

* Weekly meeting at Tuesday
* Weekly Meeting at Tutorial
* Grammar & Plagiarism Check - Proposal and Presentation
* Project Idea Submission
* Topic Selection and Confirmation
* Oral Pitch
* Project Proposal (Oral Pitch Feedback Included) - High Level Requirement

* Design Discussion - Features and Research
* Design Implementation - Diagrams and Architecture
* Design Completion (Milestone)
* Prototype Development

* Break Time - Holidays
* Testing and Optimization
* Project Completion - Deliverables (Milestone)



5.2 Technologies 

Our initial take on how we are going to build a prototype that mimics the features of UQ Explore is by building a web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript.  We can also utilise PHP to build the login page and if we find it necessary, implement a scaled down database that will hold the ID’s of the students. We will also use google maps API to mimic the interactive map for UQ market days. Different technologies will be used as a result of the challenges we face during build.
