            <h1>What is UQ Explore?</h1>
            <p>UQ Explore addresses the lack of ways users can get local news
            delivered conveniently to them around the University of Queensland.
            Local campus news is abundant but means to access it was not. This
            mobile app enables users to explore fun and social activities
            around campus in a way that appeals to them. It delivers local
            campus news straight to the users pocket while also providing them
            with discounts, special offers and opportunities to catch up with
            their friends or even make new ones.</p>
