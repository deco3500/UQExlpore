            <h1>The Home Feed</h1><br>
            <p>The Feed is where you'll likely be spending most of your time in UQ Explore. This is where you'll get to see all of the great things happening around your campus and is also the place where you can check into these events. Checking into events will allow your friends to know where you are so you can all have a great time at the same event. You can also search for events, if you feel like you missed an important detail such as the time or place, in the search bar at the top of the feed.</p><br>

            <h1>Rewards</h1>
            <p>This is where the good stuff is, this is where the cheap stuff is, this is where the rewards are. The rewards section will keep you coming back for $5 burritos and 2 for 1 Smoothies. But don't think we'll just give you these amazing deals, you'll have to solve a riddle to find the deal. But these deals aren't exclusive to the big food stores on campus either, smaller events can also have deals on club membership, sausage sizzles, and sign up costs.  All of these are accessible from here as well as the feed. So lets be honest, you come for the news but you stay for the food.</p>

        <div class="community">
            <h1>Community</h1><br>
            <p>This is where you get to see what your friends are up to as well as make new ones. Here is where you'll add new friends, let new friends add you, and also customise your profile. Upload a picture of yourself, set your name and bio and then venture out and find friends. You can search for friends by either their name or UQ email in the search bar and then its a simple tap and you're friends, once they accept the request at least.</p><br>
            <p>
             Not only does UQ Explore put all of the non-academic campus news at your fingertips but it also makes it fun and interesting by pairing it with a fun game mode that allows you to reap real life rewards.
